cucumber_atm
============

Code that corresponds to the "nice_bank" program created within The Cucumber Book (prior to going async)

I love [The Cucumber Book](http://pragprog.com/book/hwcuc/the-cucumber-book)! It's a great introduction to [Behavior-Driven Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development).
